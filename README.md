# Police-Siren-Project-using-555-Timer-in-Proteus
This project has a complete circuit for Police Siren. one can add the real siren sound in Proteus according to need. By using two 555 Timer ICs,the circuit outputs a clear stream of the police siren sound. In addition to 555 Timer ICs, simple devices are used in this project such as Resistor and capacitor etc. You can check other exceptional projects on www.theengineeringprojects.com .
